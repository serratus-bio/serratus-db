# Serratus Summary File Parser & API

> This program has two parts (intended for separation in the future): the parser (parser.cs) and the web API (/controllers).

> If you would like to run the parser, add the method "RunParser()" to the Main method in program.cs before the "CreateHostBuilder(args).Build().Run()" method. The parser will run and keep running until all files are parsed.

> If you would like to run the API, ensure that only the "CreateHostBuilder(args).Build().Run()" method is present in the Main method in program.cs. This will start up the web API on a localhost server in your browser when ran on Debug/Release IIS Express in Visual Studio.
